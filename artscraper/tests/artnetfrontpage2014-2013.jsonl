{"para": "There is only one tool trusted by art world insiders to buy, sell and research art: the Artnet Price Database. Its users across industries\u2014from auction houses to museums, galleries, and government institutions\u2014represent the art world\u2019s most important players. We\u2019re taking 15 minutes to chat with some of the  Artnet Price Databas e\u2019s power users to get their take on the current state of the market and how they\u2019re keeping up with the latest trends. They say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So maybe it\u2019s also true that the journey to becoming one of the top jewelry professionals in the world begins with a small collectible set.  That sentiment holds in the case of Daphne Lingon, Christie\u2019s head of jewelry for the Americas, who tells us that she still has a gemstone collection she bought from Sharper Image during her childhood in Michigan. \u201cMy father was a coin collector, so perhaps there was something in the air,\u201d Daphne says.  She grew up completely \u201cconsumed\u201d by jewelry, as she puts it, spending her spare time reading books and magazines about precious stones. Since then, Daphne has gone on to make jewelry history, playing an integral role in record-breaking sales and handling tens of thousands of jewels and gemstones.   \u00a0 Like a mother talking about her children, how could I say only one is my favorite? And yet, there are some pieces that are especially meaningful or that have greatly impacted the market. I\u2019d include   the Oppenheimer Blue Diamond, the duPont Ruby and duPont Emerald from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the diamond \u201cTube\u201d bracelet, c. 1948, by Suzanne Belperron, Le Grand Mazarin Diamond, and of course, the Collection of Elizabeth Taylor. Over four months, Christie\u2019s traveled highlights of the [Taylor] auction all over the world, and whether in the U.S. or abroad, people lined up to see her jewels. I was involved with the exhibitions in Moscow and the Middle East, which were fascinating, as they drew tremendous crowds. The record-breaking results speak to the remarkable interest in Taylor and the excellence of her collection. The first thing that sets jewelry apart from, say, paintings is also the most obvious: jewelry is worn, and that in itself makes it more personal and intimate. Quite often these jewels and gemstones are being purchased to mark important milestones such as engagements, birthdays, or anniversaries. So, a client\u2019s own style and even his or her lifestyle affects nearly every single purchase. When we\u2019re handling an estate, the heirs tend to be emotionally invested and we do our best to honor their wishes for the \u201cnext\u201d owner of their jewelry from the family\u2019s collection. We can include biographies about the owner of a collection or images of the jewels being worn, which is also our way of describing the foundation of a collection. Whether someone is buying or selling jewelry, sentiment is a significant factor, and one we strive to respect. Hands down, this would have to be the power of the internet. The impact and reach of social media such as Instagram have played a huge role in our field. The Christie\u2019s jewelry department account on Instagram has nearly 500,000 followers, and through WeChat we\u2019ve been able to reach a vast audience in Asia, far beyond traditional marketing parameters. It so happens that in 2011, Christie\u2019s was at the forefront of online jewelry sales when we offered nearly 2,000 lots from the collection of Elizabeth Taylor in that format, which performed with tremendous results. This year, we set the record for a jewel sold online, with a beautiful 28.86 carat D color diamond selling for $2.1 million, which really demonstrates the trust we have built in our digital platform. In the world of fine jewelry, trends per se are less impactful. I would say that overall in the past decade we\u2019ve certainly seen more women buying for themselves. These are women who are successful, independent, and know their own taste. They\u2019re also comfortable with buying from a number of jewelry houses and designers. The first thing that sets jewelry apart from, say, paintings, is also the most obvious: jewelry is worn, and that in itself makes it more personal and intimate. First and foremost, buy what you love. I am often asked should someone buy Art Deco, or colored diamonds, or signed jewels, and my answer always begins the same way: \u201cBuy what you love.\u201d If you are truly interested in collecting, then focus on what sparks your interest. In the long run, passion is what sustains every collector.  But with love there must be knowledge, and I always encourage new collectors to read and research, to build a resource library, and to attend auction previews, go to lectures. As for our role at Christie\u2019s, we encourage emerging collectors to develop relationships with the specialists. We try to be sensitive to the new collector whose passion is genuine, and this is a perfect opportunity for a collector to learn from us, and with us. We want to help train someone\u2019s eye. We can\u2019t train passion, but we can guide and advise. And every new collector needs to handle as much jewelry as possible. It\u2019s really the best way to learn.\u00a0\u00a0 I think more than choosing one house or designer, I would have to say that there are periods and designs that I love: Georgian eye and paste jewelry, 1950s diamond and gold jewelry by Cartier, sautoirs by Bulgari and Van Cleef & Arpels from the 1970s, to name just a few. Designers would have to include Belperron, Bhagat, Boivin, Cartier, Flato, JAR, James de Givenchy (Taffin), Hemmerle, Templier, Tiffany, Verdura and Van Cleef & Arpels.  But to me, it\u2019s more about the jewel itself than just a particular designer or house. I also love discovering new designers, which is more possible today than ever through the power of platforms like Instagram. Unsigned jewels can also be impactful, and I always encourage clients to look at the details, not just the name. The beauty of jewelry is that there is something new to see and learn every single day. It\u2019s what keeps us on our toes! The last thing I looked up in the Price Database was Suzanne Belperron. We are so grateful that Artnet is now incorporating jewelry into its database, as having this as a tool helps to aggregate recent prices and records. This interview has been edited and condensed.

{"para": "\u00a0 Fine watchmaking and the arts have a long parallel history. In great examples of both, craft, history, and specific absorbing details take center stage, producing\u00a0 strong emotional reactions in art and watch lovers alike.\u00a0 The Swiss luxury watch house Audemars Piguet\u2014one of the oldest watch companies in the world, established by Jules Louis Audemars and Edward Auguste Piguet in 1875\u2014has for many years run an art program, Audemars Piguet Contemporary, that exists separately from its watchmaking initiative, aiming to support artists from around the world in their endeavors to investigate lived experiences of all kinds.\u00a0 To discuss the program, the links between horology and contemporary art, and how artwork can help viewers enhance their emotional intelligence, Artnet News spoke with Audemars Piguet\u2019s in-house art curators, Audrey Teichmann and Denis Pernet.\u00a0  I joined Audemars Piguet last year after a few years working as a curator in architecture for Villa Noailles in France and also for Galerie Lauren Bernard in Geneva, so I had experience in transdisciplinary arts and supporting artists through the gallery spectrum. Before that, I worked in research, like Denis, at HEAD, a design school in Geneva, where I was able to follow the work of art and design students and try to share critical points of view on subjects that are very important to the cultural moment, which I really enjoyed.  I really liked that with AP, you could support artists with carte blanche, and give them opportunities that they might not otherwise have. It\u2019s important for us to be radical, and to have a practice that really respects the core of the research and the diversity of positions that artists represent today.  I joined in 2018. For a long time, I was a curator at the Contemporary Art Center in Geneva, where I was mostly doing solo exhibitions and producing new artworks. Then for many years, I was doing research and freelance work as an independent curator. Like Audrey, I was really happy to join a program such as AP\u2019s that\u2019s very focused on supporting new production and developing projects with the artists we work with.\u00a0 Isle of Instability What we do is support international artists by commissioning new artworks from them. We let them decide what they want to do\u2014maybe they want to redevelop a project they didn\u2019t get to do yet or reimagine it as something more ambitious or something new. We support diversity in our artist selection\u2014they can be emerging or mid-career or more established if the support makes sense. The artwork belongs to the artist so it\u2019s part of their body of their work and will eventually be exhibited with their other projects and in future shows. We also follow the development of the project from inception to the first presentation and exhibition. We\u2019re very happy to accompany the artist afterwards, too, if they have another opportunity to present the work and need our help. Also, it is important to mention that we are co-curators in house, and it\u2019s not only financial support that we provide, but a curatorial dialogue as well. That\u2019s why we mention the fact that it\u2019s a long-term relationship: it\u2019s important to go beyond the immediate collaboration, to follow the presentation of the artwork, and to support the artist in the continuation of their careers.\u00a0 We have two kinds of programs within the larger program.  The Audemars Piguet Art Commission is one of the programs, a competition that takes place every two years in which we invite a guest curator who is an expert in his or her region to participate. With their guidance, we select an artist. They then produce a large-scale artwork; most of the time, it\u2019s a first attempt at a project of that scale\u2014we tend to support artists who are not yet internationally recognized, and that\u2019s very important to us. We\u2019re working on our fifth commission at the moment, and it\u2019s going to be held in April and May in Hong Kong. We\u2019re working with two Hong Kong-based persons, Ying Kwok\u2014she was the curator of the Hong Kong pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale\u2014and the artist she selected, Phoebe Hui. Her practice is research-based, and the project she\u2019s doing for us is called  The Moon Is Leaving Us . It\u2019s a great project, a poetic interpretation of the fact that the moon is slowly but surely migrating away from the earth. And our part is to facilitate dialogue around it and help her deepen her research\u2014for example, we helped her to meet with a former astronaut and provided a lot of information that was key for her, including data we pulled on the mutable laws of the universe and how they could be best represented visually.\u00a0  The other program we have is called Studio Audemars Piguet.  For that one, we go directly to an established artist and propose him or her to develop a commissioned artwork, whatever they want to do. We accompany them from the development of the idea to the exhibition. A few years ago, for example, we had a conversation with the Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda. He had a very ambitious and a little bit crazy idea of doing a trilogy of video works called  data-verse . It was going to translate in images all the data that human culture has produced, from the microscopic\u2014for example, the quark on the inside of an atom\u2014to the macroscopic.  We were very happy to help him present the first part of the trilogy, which was shown in the international exhibition of the 2019 Venice Biennale, curated by Ralph Rugoff. We then had the opportunity to present the first and second variations in tandem at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in Germany last November as two immense, synchronised projects. And now in London, at 180 the Strand, the third variation and the complete trilogy is ready to be presented in the same room. It\u2019s not open yet, but we hope it will debut in March or April.\u00a0  Essentially, it\u2019s about the interests of the artists and their practices, their contributions to the contemporary art discourse today and also the diversity of positions they stand for. Engaging with all this is also why we work with invited curators\u2014most of the time they have an interest in specific questions that are very important to the regions they represent. They are very involved and sensitive to the evolution of the specific art scenes they come from and the artists they\u2019re interested in working with.\u00a0  In addition to the independent curators, we consult our colleagues, too. We\u2019re a company that\u2019s present in many countries, which is also why we\u2019re so interested in artwork from a global standpoint. We collaborate with our international colleagues frequently\u2014for instance, we worked with our colleagues in China to do something at the West Bund Art & Design fair last year, where we had the great opportunity to commission a work by  Cao Fei . We also try to work with artists who can provide a certain critique or point of view on the world we live in today and how to better understand it and imagine what the future might look like. Topics we return to again and again are technology, science, and cultural identity. We\u2019re also working with the Norwegian artist  Jana Winderen  whose work covers a number of environmental issues and seeks to raise awareness about the ways in which we treat the planet and its living creatures. Research-based practices are especially interesting and appealing to us. Where we see affinities is really in the interest of going beyond a first impression or a first look, which is applicable to both worlds. You know, fine watchmaking has such a degree of refinement that you can really enjoy learning about horology as a kind of science all its own; it\u2019s packed with history, science and stories of craftsmanship. And the same goes for contemporary art. The more you know about it, the more you understand it.\u00a0  We\u2019re also always looking for different perspectives in how both practices can bring value to lived experiences in society. We like to introduce that dialogue to both art lovers and watch lovers and engage them in a conversation.\u00a0 It\u2019s an interesting question because we\u2019re never really working alone. It\u2019s a job in which you have to talk a lot since nearly every part of it is collaborative. It has also made me sensitive to the fact that doing this kind of work is about everlasting change and mutability and the evolution of work, from its inception to its realization. It makes you question your own ideas all the time.  What has always amazed me is how efficient and fast artists can be and how they take constraints and deal with them in very inventive, productive ways. It\u2019s amazing to see how quickly artists imagine solutions, which also leaves a lot of time for the philosophical aspect of the work. I really enjoy the balance between the practicalities of completing and then showing an artwork, and the desire to talk about the subject matter which often focuses on larger life things that we all spend a lot of time thinking about.\u00a0 Audrey:  If you look at emotional intelligence as something that assesses your ability to understand yourself and others, we truly believe that art is one of the greatest ways to engage people in that conversation. How we choose the work we show is very much based on how you experience it, so we choose art based on the strength and range of emotions it procures, from joy to sorrow to hope. We are convinced that these ways of questioning and discussing art can deepen someone\u2019s emotional intelligence.\u00a0\u00a0 We also tend to choose artists that are really interested in these questions themselves and how they apply to issues surrounding social and environmental issues and questions of identity. I think constantly being around artwork in our professional lives has really enhanced our own senses of empathy, too.

That\u2019s right: It\u2019s 2021 in Pandemic America and  Ryder Ripps  is dating  Azealia Banks . According to a spree of Instagram stories, the two have been frolicking through sunny  Miami Beach , staying at the  Versace Mansion , and running happily through parking garages and museums. Who are these charming lovebirds, and what makes them a bonkers-unlikely couple that is somehow perfectly suited to these dystopian times? Ripps is a vaguely post-internet artist who\u2019s largely abandoned showing at traditional galleries such as  Postmasters \u00a0in favor of doing design work for such zeitgeist-y brands as  Soylent  and  Pornhub . He\u2019s also a kind of post-modern meta-troll. (He  recently took credit  for designing the new logo for the  CIA , sending the internet into a tailspin; he did not actually design it.) And what of Azealia Banks? In 2011, she released a pulsating song called \u201c212\u201d later named one of the best singles of the decade by  Pitchfork  and  Billboard . But alas, she\u2019s perhaps best known for taking potshots at a dizzying array of pop culture figures ranging from\u00a0 Pharrell\u00a0 to\u00a0 Russell Crowe \u00a0to\u00a0 Nicki Minaj . In 2018, she accused  Lana Del Rey  of doing \u201clittle Lolita chola cosplay,\u201d leading Lana to respond via tweet that she \u201cwon\u2019t not fuck you the fuck up.\u201d There was also that time  she live-streamed hanging out solo  at  Elon Musk \u2019s house after his partner  Grimes  invited her over, but never showed up. And so it was somewhat surreal to see these two forces of nature collide. Last week, Banks posted an image to her Instagram stories of her next to a shirtless Ripps, and then a picture of them underneath the gigantic  Keith Haring  at the  Rubell Museum  in  Miami . Ripps posted to his stories an image of them embracing in masks, and then reposted another person who had added the caption \u201cpower couple.\u201d Will the romance last? That remains to be seen. But in the spirit of the holiday, let\u2019s hold out hope. We did not hear back from reps for Banks, and Ripps didn\u2019t respond to an email. \u00a0 EVERYTHING\u2019S COMING UP ROSAS Two weeks ago,  Wet Paint   unspooled a twisted and strange tale  of a friendship undone by an alleged forgery. Sources detailed allegations that young artist  Christian Rosa  had taken an unfinished work from the studio of his mentor, the legendary  Raymond Pettibon , finished it himself, and then attempted to sell it for more than $1 million. Advisors with knowledge of the deal indicated that the work came close to selling\u2014which makes sense. A large Pettibon wave painting for a million bucks would be a steal\u2026 that is, unless the work  itself  were stolen, as multiple sources suggested. In the weeks that followed, nearly a dozen additional sources close to both artists came forward with more information about Rosa\u2019s long relationship with Pettibon. Four of them indicated that, based on information they have, rather than an isolated alleged incident, the tainted wave painting may have been one of at least  three \u00a0said to have been taken from Pettibon and later put on the market. The relationship between the two artists began over a decade ago, when Pettibon met Rosa through artist\u00a0 Daniel Richter , who was teaching the rising star at the  Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste  in  Vienna .\u00a0In 2010, Rosa took a road trip out west to visit Pettibon and crash at his  Venice Beach  home, which doubled as a studio. A source present at the time said that, in his recollection, Pettibon had works on paper around the studio and Rosa took some unfinished\u00a0works from the studio\u2014the unfinished works that he would later finish himself and offer for sale. In a statement to Wet Paint, a representative from Raymond Pettibon\u2019s studio said that the artist never purposefully gave any works to Christian Rosa, and had no knowledge of Rosa having the works. According to sources, the two artists maintained a relationship\u2014\u201cthis super loose, boozy, casual/informal, trusting friendship,\u201d as a source put it\u2014until Pettibon found out that Rosa was allegedly trying to sell the works he took from the studio. At that point, the studio alerted authorities about the allegations, which is how the case came to be directed to the  FBI . (The FBI has not responded to requests for comment.) Another source suggested it was an open secret in Vienna that Rosa had taken a Pettibon from the apartment of one of Pettibon\u2019s former girlfriends and sold it to a collector in town. A different source directed me to a video of Rosa in a what almost became a physical brawl with the collector  Stefan Simchowitz  at an opening at  Ibid Gallery  in  Los Angeles . But perhaps that\u2019s a story for another day. Pettibon\u2019s studio declined to comment beyond that one statement, and his  New York  gallery,  David Zwirner , did not respond to an email.\u00a0Christian Rosa did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \u00a0 PAULA COOPER LURES DIRECTOR FROM UPTOWN POWERHOUSE This year has already been a big one for  Paula Cooper Gallery . The legendary shop known for\u00a0championing a generation of minimalist and conceptual artists has expanded beyond New York for the first time in its 53-year history with  a new outpost in Palm Beach . Now, it\u2019s making power moves on the staff side as well.  Wet Paint  can reveal that  Alexis Johnson , long a secret weapon at  L\u00e9vy Gorvy , will be leaving her job to become a senior director at Paula Cooper. It marks a homecoming for Johnson\u2014she worked at the gallery for six years starting in 2010. \u201cShe is an indefatigable advocate on behalf of art and artists, and we are excited to see her resume longstanding relationships with our artists, as well as forge new bonds,\u201d said  Steven Henry , senior director of the gallery. She\u2019ll be working out of  Chelsea , while Henry will be manning the ship down in Palm Beach, where the gallery snagged a clutch space on the tony stretch of  Worth Avenue . \u00a0 POP QUIZ Just in time for all that  GameStop  commotion in the markets, the last  Pop Quiz  was a still from the film  Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps ; the work in question is an  Antony Gormley \u00a0in  Gordon Gekko \u2019s  London  office.

{"para": "One of the most famous paintings in the world, Vincent van Gogh\u2019s\u00a0 Starry Night , has inspired everything from  socks  to  umbrellas \u00a0to  face masks . Now, the 1889 Post-Impressionist masterpiece will have  its very own Lego set , allowing art lovers to recreate the Dutch artist\u2019s most beloved work entirely from interlocking plastic bricks. The kit is the brainchild of  Truman Cheng , a 25-year-old PhD student from Hong Kong, who submitted the idea to  Lego Ideas , which allows fans of the colorful construction toys to share their suggestions for future Lego kits. Any project that receives at least 10,000 votes from the public enters an official review process and can potentially be chosen by the Danish company to be produced as a commercial set, with the original designer earning one percent of royalties. Cheng\u2019s\u00a0 Starry Night  is unique in that it uses thin Lego plate pieces to approximate Van Gogh\u2019s dramatic skies. The design uses about 1,500 Lego parts, including a tiny mini figure of the painter himself, at work in front of an easel and canvas. Starry Night \u201cOne day, I was just playing with Lego parts, and I realized stacking Lego plates together in random intervals looks a lot like Van Gogh\u2019s iconic brush strokes,\u201d\u00a0Cheng told  Lego\u00a0Ideas . He spent several weeks coming up with the design, working after shifts as a postgrad research assistant. \u201cIt was a good brain tease to come up with tricks and techniques to capture the look of the original painting,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThe brushwork goes into many directions in the moon and the swirling cloud, so there was some creative use of bracket and clip elements involved.\u201d Cheng\u2019s\u00a0 Starry Night \u00a0design was one of a record 35 projects considered in Lego Ideas\u2019 most recent review period, reflecting a surge of interest during 2020.\u00a0Since Lego Ideas\u2019 launch in 2008, 41 sets have been selected for production. \u201cArt is a theme that we\u2019ve only recently ventured into,\u201d Hasan Jensen, the Lego Ideas engagement manager, said in the  announcement  for the Van Gogh kit, praising \u201cthe unique building techniques [Cheng has] used to recreate the beautiful brush strokes in Lego bricks.\u201d For Cheng, the leap from Lego to art was a natural one. \u201cTo me, Lego is more than \u2018toys,'\u201d he said. \u201cI can express myself, create characters and sculptures from my imagination.\u2026\u00a0very much like painting. It\u2019s also like a puzzle game, because there are rules and \u2018maths\u2019 to how bricks can be connected, so there is \u2018creative limitations\u2019 going on too. So I guess to me, Lego is a unique synthesis of artistic expression and puzzle-solving.\u201d The company introduced a  Lego Art  series last June, with mosaic-like kits featuring new 2-D tiles aimed at adults to put on display. Most of the kits draw their subject matter from pop culture, with sets inspired by Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter, and the Beatles. The only artist featured is Andy Warhol, whose work is the subject of a  $119.99   Marilyn Monroe kit , which features four different possible color schemes. The kit, produced in collaboration with the Warhol Foundation, allows art lovers to hang Lego versions of the famous Pop art silkscreen on their walls, featuring an \u201cexclusive signature title\u201d with the artist\u2019s signed name on a Lego brick.

{"para": "As auction houses prepare to enter another season with most of the world in lockdown, they are seeking ways to make sure their sales still feel like events. To that end, Christie\u2019s is holding a single-lot sale in Hong Kong dedicated to a pricey painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat on March 23.\u00a0 The painting, titled  Warrior,  is from 1982, Basquiat\u2019s most coveted year, and is estimated to fetch between HK$240 million and HK$320 million ($31 million to $41 million). Christie\u2019s co-head of postwar and contemporary art, Cristian Albu, tells Artnet News that the work, which carries a third-party guarantee, is expected to become the most expensive by a Western artist ever to be sold in Asia.\u00a0 The Asian market\u2019s appetite for Western art has been steadily increasing in recent years, and Albu says the auction house was particularly encouraged by last year\u2019s results,  which saw a wide net of Asian buyers bidding on work spanning the 20th century, as well as\u00a0 a new world record set for George Condo in Hong Kong  in July.\u00a0 \u201cCollectors are increasingly making links between traditional artists and Western art history,\u201d Albu says. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important to broaden that idea of building the collection and understanding that Sanyu also gets inspired by Matisse, or that Zao Wou-Ki gets inspired by Soulages and the artists in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s.\u201d Warrior  depicts a full-length figure, sword in hand. It last sold at Sotheby\u2019s London in 2012  for $8.7 m illion and has been in the same collection ever since. Before that, it had an active decade on the market, having traded hands three times in seven years. During that time, its price climbed some 450 percent.\u00a0 The single-lot sale in Hong Kong will kick off for a five-hour marathon day of sales that continues in London with Christie\u2019s 20th-century art evening sale and surrealist art evening sale. The live auctions will be digitally streamed from salesrooms in Hong Kong, London, and New York, a continuation of the  global strategy Christie\u2019s began experimenting with in July 2020 with its four-location relay sale, \u201cONE.\u201d The sale will begin at 2 p.m. London time (10 p.m. in Hong Kong, 9 a.m. in New York), an unusually early start for an \u201cevening\u201d sale, in an effort to tempt Asian buyers to stay awake and active throughout the evening while still being late enough for US bidders to have had time for a quick espresso. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt matters that Hong Kong\u2019s market seems to be recovering from the impact of the pandemic more quickly than Europe and the US. At Christie\u2019s December 2 sale in Hong Kong and New York, some 17 records were broken for modern and contemporary artists from around the world, including Dana Schutz and Amoako Boafo; it \u00a0 marked the house\u2019s best result  in Asia yet. Hong Kong sales tend to draw a whole gamut of Asian collectors, according to Albu. \u201cI was on the ground for that sale, and the whole web of collectors goes from Taiwan to China, to Hong Kong, to South Korea, to Japan, to Malaysia, Indonesia, to Singapore,\u201d he says. Basquiat\u2019s  Warrior  will be on view at Christie\u2019s showroom at Rockefeller Center in New York beginning next week, before it is flown to Hong Kong to be shown at Alexandra House until the sale.

{"para": "Is it even Valentine\u2019s Day without a mild sugar overdose? From special boxes of decadent chocolate to conversation-starting candy hearts, artists may be second only to lovers when it comes to finding inspiration in the candy aisle. Some artists have used sweets as cultural commentary, like the late conceptual artist  Felix Gonzalez-Torres , whose  nuanced installations  featured piles of wrapped candies that were slowly diminished by visitors taking one piece at a time. The gradual disappearance of the candies alluded to the artist\u2019s personal experience watching his lover die from AIDS, fading slowly day by day. Other artists have incorporated real candy in their work, like performance artist  Janine Antoni,  who created 14 sculptural busts cast from her own body for an installation called\u00a0 Lick and Lather  (1993). The only catch? Seven of the busts were made from chocolate, and the other seven from soap. The artist molded each figure into different proportions by licking the chocolate and washing the soap of each bust, questioning notions of conventional beauty. So, in celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day, feast your eyes on some of the most realistic, delicious-looking, sweets-inspired artworks. \u00a0 Peter Anton \n  (2015) \n Artist Peter Anton has made a career out of super-sizing everything sweet, from doughnuts to cupcakes, and of course the ubiquitous box of chocolates.\u00a0\u201cI have an innate reverence for the things we eat,\u201d he once said, and his meticulously detailed sculptures do, in fact, look good enough to eat. \u00a0 Gina Beavers \n (2016) \n If it looks like  Gina Beavers\u2019s sculptural paintings  are drawn straight from Instagram, it\u2019s because they are. Applying layers of thick paint in garish colors, Beavers riffs on themes of self-promotion and takes the term \u201cfood porn\u201d literally. In her painting\u00a0 The Life I Deserve , which also served as the title for her first solo show at MoMA PS1 in 2019, Beavers\u2019s themes of  consumption, both online and IRL, coalesce  into an image that is as repellent as it is delightful. Will Cotton \n Delicious\u00a0 (2008) New York City-based artist Will Cotton was the creative director for Katy Perry\u2019s music video\u00a0 California Gurls , set in a fanciful utopia called \u201cCandyfornia,\u201d and the pop star looked like one of Cotton\u2019s models come to life. Whipped-cream coifs and cotton-candy clouds set the scene for the magical, sensual romp that featured themes the artist has incorporated into his work for decades. In Cotton\u2019s\u00a0 Delicious\u00a0 (2008), which would have given Marie Antoinette\u2019s confections a run for their money, a multi-tiered cake threatens to tumble under the weight of spun sugar and fondant icing\u2014a dark reality often facing those who indulge in too much pleasure seeking. \u00a0 Desire Obtain Cherish (DOC) \n Various Meltdowns  (2014) \n Feeling lovelorn this holiday season? Street artist turned contemporary art impresario Jonathan Paul, who works under the name  Desire Obtain Cherish  (DOC), has just the work for you. Creating sculptural riffs on pop culture, DOC\u2019s work might seem sweet, but at its core it\u2019s a salty commentary on  conspicuous consumption and material obsessions . If the melting lollipops don\u2019t do it for you, perhaps a giant blister pack of luxury-brand-stamped pills is more to taste.

{"para": "This spring, a city in Spain will become a European art destination when it opens a major expansion to one of the continent\u2019s leading collections of contemporary art. German art collector and dealer\u00a0Helga\u00a0de Alvear, who is also one of the founders of the fair ARCOMadrid, has amassed a formidable collection of 3,000 contemporary artworks over four decades. She has gifted the collection\u2014in its entirety\u2014to the Spanish region of Extremadura and will also donate a just-completed museum in the city of\u00a0C\u00e1ceres to house it. The expanded and restored museum is set to display works by the likes of Joseph Beuys, Dan Flavin, Joseph Albers, Paul Klee, Nan Goldin, and Jenny Holzer, to name a few.\u00a0All told, the collection contains work by 500 artists.\u00a0A portion of the collection, around 200 works, will be unveiled when the museum reopens its doors this spring.\u00a0Access to the museum will remain free to the public. \u201cI am interested in contemporary art because it speaks to us of our time and of ourselves, because it creates and develops a language that can explain, in a new way, the world in which we happen to live and of which we often only brush the surface,\u201d said de Alvear in a statement. A smaller version of the museum and de Alvear\u2019s foundation has been running on the same site since 2010. The first location for the museum, a 1913 villa, remains but is now built out by\u00a0a hyper-modern, white-slated building, which was designed by Tu\u00f1\u00f3n Arquitectos Studio. Construction on the site broke ground in 2015 and cost \u20ac10 million, which was split between de Alvear and the Regional Minister of Culture, Tourism and Sports, Government of Extremadura. \u201cBoth buildings are similar and different in dimension and shape,\u201d architect Tu\u00f1\u00f3n explained to  Dezeen  when the expansion was first announced. \u201cThey are complementary in terms of volume and different in terms of construction and image. But the two together constitute the new image of C\u00e1ceres.\u201d A rare and well-preserved edition of Goya\u2019s\u00a0 Los Caprichos\u00a0 aquatint, as well as etchings from the last 16th century (the museum says it considers Goya the first contemporary artist), will be on view alongside works by Louise Bourgeois, Thomas Hirschhorn, and Nan Goldin. Modern artists like Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso are also featured. De Alvear, who was born in Germany, spent most of her life in Madrid.\u00a0In 1967, de Alvear met Juana Mord\u00f3, an art dealer and prominent cultural figure in Spain. She worked at\u00a0Juana Mord\u00f3 gallery before taking over after Mord\u00f3 died. She then made waves in 1995 when she opened her own eponymous gallery steps from the\u00a0 Reina Sof\u00eda \u00a0Museum, with a focus on\u00a0photography, video, and installation\u2014experimental mediums at the time. She represents artists Angela Bulloch, Thomas Demand, and Elmgreen & Dragset. Follow   on Facebook: ", "captions": [" (2006) by Katharina Grosse. \u00a9 Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s.

{"para": "For the Caribbean-born artist  Firelei B\u00e1ez , her childhood creativity was associated with causing trouble and upending the status quo. They even called her \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was \u2018The Demolisher\u2019 or \u2018The Hellion,'\u201d she says in an exclusive  new video interview . Filmed as part of the new season of Art21\u2019s series\u00a0 New York Close Up \u00a0 series ,  the painter delves into her upbringing on the border of the\u00a0 Dominican Republic and Haiti, explaining how it informed her lusciously detailed works which blend mythical stories from folklore, scientific taxonomy, and a range of perspectives from the African diaspora.  The beauty in B\u00e1ez\u2019s work, which often centers on the female figure, is underpinned by a current of something sinister. But the artist sees the bodies she paints as misunderstood. In the interview, B\u00e1ez  describes  the Dominican mythological trickster figures, the\u00a0 ciguapas,\u00a0 who appear as cunning seductresses with backward feet that literally lead people down the wrong paths.\u00a0 \u201cShe was meant to be something that made us so fearful, that we could be quiet for long enough to be groomed into civility,\u201d  B\u00e1ez explains.  But what if we could shift that perception and celebrate these figures as individuals? \u201cThe understory,\u201d B\u00e1ez continues, \u201cis they are highly independent, they\u2019re self-possessed, and they feel deeply.\u201d In her painting\u00a0 Untitled (Le Jeu du Monde) \u00a0(2020) the figures are represented not as running amok, but shape-shifting, morphing between species, emphasizing the false notion that identity is fixed.\u00a0 Beginning in July 2021, the artist will present her largest sculptural installation to date at  Boston\u2019s ICA Watershed , which imagines archaeological ruins from Haiti that have cropped up in the bustling city. Drawing on Boston\u2019s proximity to water and its history of revolution, B\u00e1ez plans to evoke ideas of international exchange, culture, and identity.
